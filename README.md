I developed the SF Shoes Landing Page, a dynamic and visually appealing online storefront designed to showcase high-quality shoe collections. Leveraging ReactJS and React Hooks, the application delivers a smooth, interactive experience with optimized performance through Vite. The UI is crafted using TailwindCSS, ensuring responsiveness and a sleek, modern design.

Key features of this project include:
Showcase of New Arrivals & Customer Favorites – Highlighting popular products with ratings and pricing.
SEO-Optimized & Performance-Driven – Fast-loading pages with an efficient React architecture.
User-Centric Interface – Engaging, intuitive, and mobile-friendly design.
Special Offers & Testimonials – Reinforcing credibility through customer reviews and discount promotions.

With a focus on user experience, performance, and accessibility, this project demonstrates my expertise in ReactJS development, TailwindCSS styling, and modern front-end optimization.
